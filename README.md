# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
In this project, I worked on a comprehensive Microsoft Excel dataset containing detailed information about various countries' coffee sales. The focus of the project was to effectively clean and analyze the dataset using advanced Excel functionalities. I employed various data cleaning methods, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset.

To enhance data organization and accessibility, I utilized powerful Excel functions like XLOOKUP and IFS to efficiently retrieve and categorize specific information from the dataset. Additionally, I created dynamic pivot tables and a variety of charts to visually represent the sales performance of different countries over time, allowing for intuitive insights into the trends and fluctuations in coffee sales.

Moreover, I incorporated slicers and a timeline feature into the Excel file, enabling the user or client to effortlessly navigate and filter the data based on specific criteria such as country names, total sales over time, top 5 customers, and selection of years, coffee sizes, and roast types. This functionality empowers the user to interact with the data dynamically, gaining valuable insights tailored to their specific requirements.

Overall, the project aimed to transform raw data into meaningful and actionable insights, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing coffee sales data with ease.
